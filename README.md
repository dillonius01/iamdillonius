# I am Dillonius

## About
A static site to show the world a bit about my coding abilities.
You can see the site live at <a href="http://dillonius.com">dillonius.com</a>

## Thought Process
#### Front-End
I used React and Redux, but the scale of this app didn't really demand it. My goal was to learn how to make a beautiful React-Redux app with the polish of CSS animations, which is not something I had done before. Looking back, I spent most of my time learning about the intricacies of CSS/Sass, which was a great learning experience.

#### Back-End
I'm using Webpack to bundle my JavaScript and Node-Sass to compile my styles. The server file is pretty simple and currently used only for development. I'm able to host on Github Pages because, once the JS and CSS are ready to deploy, the only server functionality needed is serving up some static files.

## Future Direction
Down the road, I may want to expand the scope and build out my own blogging platform. That, and maybe integrate some maps. Everyone loves maps.
